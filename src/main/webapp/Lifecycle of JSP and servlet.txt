CGI vs Servlet

CGI-Common Gateway Interface. Tech was propular in early 90s and late 90s. Problem was that 
websites needed to be opened in separate instances of the browser, this puts more load on OS.
Another issues was when multiple clients requested the same page, each client was treated as a
different process; this causes overloading of the server.

Advantage of servlet is that it will not treat different clients as different process, it will 
consider them as threads in a process. this decreases the load on ther server as multiple threads can
be ran on the same process.

Now a days we have event handling where users are given tokens and they are in a que, like hibernate
and angular

Life cycle of a servlet - this a time period of a servlet

	1.) Convert servlet to byte code which is .class file 
	2.) Load servlet instance which is object of the Servlet
	3.) then call init method, which is inbuilt in the servlet adn automatically invokes
	4.) then call the service method, both init and service method is called by tomcat
	5.) service method decides which method is going to execute, doPost or doGet. When 
	these methods are called they go to service method.
	6.) finally destry method detroys the memory of the servlet from the server
Life cycle of a jsp - jsp is an easier way to write in form of html,which 
	will later be converted to a java servlet

	1.) translate jsp to a servlet. 
	2.)  Compile and coznvert to bytecode
	3.) create instance
	4.) load servlet instace
	5.) call jspinit
	6.) call _jspService()
	7.) call jspDestroy()
