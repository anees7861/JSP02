When user logs in it saves the info using cookies in the browser. 
Difference between session and cookies is that session ends after a browser but cookies can persist
even if the machine is restarted. Cookies that are deleted after browser is closed is called non-persistent cookie
otherwise they are called are persistent cookie

1. create a cookie in LoginCheck servlet
	// use this to create a cookie object and set names for uname and pass
				Cookie ck1 = new Cookie("un", u.getUser()); 
				Cookie ck2 = new Cookie("pass", u.getPass());
				
				// set cookie expiration timer
				ck1.setMaxAge(30);
				ck2.setMaxAge(30);
				
				// add the cookies to the browser
				resp.addCookie(ck1); 
				resp.addCookie(ck2);

2. store the cookies in the login.jsp
	<% 
			// fecthing the cookies
			String user="",pass="";
		
		try{
			Cookie ck[] = request.getCookies(); // adds all the cookies in the browser to the array
			for(Cookie c : ck){
				if(c.getName().equals("un")){ // use this to find your cookie
					user = c.getValue(); // store the cookies for the req user
					// cookie will be deleted after the browser is 
					// closed these cookie are non-persistent cookie
					// since cookie timer is not mentioned 
				}
				else if(c.getName().equals("pass")){
					pass=c.getValue();
				}
				}
			}catch(Exception e){
				
			}
